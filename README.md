# The Island Escape

Welcome to The Island Escape, this game was made during the Kenney Jam 2021 where we had 48 hours to create the game, the theme is Rotation and an additional challenge to the game jam was only being able to use art assets that were created by Kenney.  
The game can be played on [https://chandlerpope.itch.io/theislandescape](https://chandlerpope.itch.io/theislandescape "The Island Escape")
